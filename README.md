# distrmultifit

The ```multi_fit.R``` builds upon the fitdistrplus R package to:

- Fit multiple distributions
- Compute the Corrected AIC, difference in AIC (information loss)  and Akaike weights for each fitted distribution.
- Rank the distributions based on the AIC metrics
- Generate Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) plots for the distributions specified.

A paper (accepted for publication) demonstrates the use of ```multi_fit.R``` for the application of identifying an appropriate distribution for a set of wall U-value measurements from English homes. However, the method can be applied to any case where multiple distributions are to be fitted and compared.  Use ```demo_beyond_normal.R``` to reproduce the published work or adjust it to fit your own analysis. The method is adapted from Delignette-Muller and Durang (2015).
